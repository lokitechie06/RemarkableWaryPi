RANDOM

1. randomly print an integer between 7 and 15 inclusive

hint - use random.randrange() to a random integer in a given range

import random
print(random.randrange(7,16))


2. randomly generate a list with 5 numbers, which are divisible by 5 and 7, between 1 and 1000 inclusive

hint - use random.sample() to generate a list of random values

import random
print(random.sample([i for i in range(1,1001) if i%5==0 and i%7==0], 5))


3. randomly generate a list with 5 even numbers between 100 and 200 inclusive

import random
print(random.sample([i for i in range(100,201) if i%2==0],5))


4. generate a list with 5 random numbers between 100 and 200 inclusive

import random
print(random.sample(100,201),5)
